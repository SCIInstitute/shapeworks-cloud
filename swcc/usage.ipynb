The \"Post\" datasets are late-gadolinium\\n enhanced images of the patient heart from 3 to 6 months AFTER RF ablation.\\n\\n Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in the \"Pre\" images is hypothesized to\\n represent fibrosis, or structural remodeling of the endocardial tissue that is\\n correlated with the progression of AF.  Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in\\n the \"Post\" images is due mainly to scarring from the RF ablation.\\n\\n = LATE GADOLINIUM ENHANCED MRI ACQUISITION =\\n\\n  LGE-MRI scans were obtained to assess both the extent of LA fibrosis pre\\n  ablation and the post ablation scarring on LA wall. LGE-MRI scans were\\n  obtained on either a 1.5 Tesla Avanto or a 3.0 Tesla Verio clinical scanner\\n  (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The scan was acquired 15\\n  minutes following contrast agent injection (0.1 mmol/kg, Multihance [Bracco\\n  Diagnostic Inc., Princeton, NJ]) using a 3D inversion recovery, respiration\\n  navigated, ECG-gated, gradient echo pulse sequence. Typical acquisition\\n  parameters were: free-breathing using navigator gating, a transverse imaging\\n  volume with voxel size = 1.25 × 1.25 × 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.625 × 0.625\\n  × 1.25 mm), repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 5.4/2.3 ms, flip angle=20\\n  degrees, inversion time (TI) = 270 - 310 ms, and GRAPPA with R = 2 and 46\\n  reference lines. ECG gating was used to acquire a small subset of phase\\n  encoding views during the diastolic phase of the LA cardiac cycle. The time\\n  interval between the R-peak of the ECG and the start of data acquisition was\\n  defined using the cine images of the LA. The TI value for the LGE-MRI scan\\n  was identified using a scout scan.\\n\\n = LEFT ATRIUM SEGMENTATIONS =\\n\\n  Each dataset (\"Pre\" and \"Post\") includes manual segmentations of (1) the\\n  endocardial surface of the left atrium and (2) the left-atrial wall.  The\\n  endocardial surface segmentation also includes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions.  The left-atrial wall segmentation excludes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions, the mitral valve, and the left-atrial appendage.\\n\\n  The pulmonary vein antrum is an important structure for understanding AF and\\n  successful RF ablations because the tissue in this region is electrically\\n  active and similar to tissue in the LA.\\n\\n  The extent of the pulmonary vein antrum regions in each endocardial\\n  segmentation was estimated using the following criteria.  There are three\\n  subjective guidelines followed when distinguishing between the PV antrum and\\n  the PV itself.\\n\\n  1) If the PV begins to branch, that is a strong indication that you are no\\n  longer in the antrum region.\\n\\n  2) The PV will stop narrowing and the diameter of the vein will remain more\\n  constant when you reach the PV proper.\\n\\n  3) On average, the PV antrum should not extend much more than about 10 mm, or\\n  roughly 3X the thickness of the LA wall.\\n\\n  The LGE-MRI image volumes and their associated left-atrial segmentations are\\n  stored in the NRRD (Nearly-Raw Raster Data) format, which is compatible with\\n  major medical image processing software such as 3D Slicer, Seg3D, ITKSnap,\\n  and other applications built from the Insight Toolkit (www.itk.org).' description='left_atrium' acknowledgement='acknowledgement' keywords='' contributors='' publications=''\n",

The \"Post\" datasets are late-gadolinium\\n enhanced images of the patient heart from 3 to 6 months AFTER RF ablation.\\n\\n Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in the \"Pre\" images is hypothesized to\\n represent fibrosis, or structural remodeling of the endocardial tissue that is\\n correlated with the progression of AF.  Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in\\n the \"Post\" images is due mainly to scarring from the RF ablation.\\n\\n = LATE GADOLINIUM ENHANCED MRI ACQUISITION =\\n\\n  LGE-MRI scans were obtained to assess both the extent of LA fibrosis pre\\n  ablation and the post ablation scarring on LA wall. LGE-MRI scans were\\n  obtained on either a 1.5 Tesla Avanto or a 3.0 Tesla Verio clinical scanner\\n  (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The scan was acquired 15\\n  minutes following contrast agent injection (0.1 mmol/kg, Multihance [Bracco\\n  Diagnostic Inc., Princeton, NJ]) using a 3D inversion recovery, respiration\\n  navigated, ECG-gated, gradient echo pulse sequence. Typical acquisition\\n  parameters were: free-breathing using navigator gating, a transverse imaging\\n  volume with voxel size = 1.25 × 1.25 × 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.625 × 0.625\\n  × 1.25 mm), repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 5.4/2.3 ms, flip angle=20\\n  degrees, inversion time (TI) = 270 - 310 ms, and GRAPPA with R = 2 and 46\\n  reference lines. ECG gating was used to acquire a small subset of phase\\n  encoding views during the diastolic phase of the LA cardiac cycle. The time\\n  interval between the R-peak of the ECG and the start of data acquisition was\\n  defined using the cine images of the LA. The TI value for the LGE-MRI scan\\n  was identified using a scout scan.\\n\\n = LEFT ATRIUM SEGMENTATIONS =\\n\\n  Each dataset (\"Pre\" and \"Post\") includes manual segmentations of (1) the\\n  endocardial surface of the left atrium and (2) the left-atrial wall.  The\\n  endocardial surface segmentation also includes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions.  The left-atrial wall segmentation excludes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions, the mitral valve, and the left-atrial appendage.\\n\\n  The pulmonary vein antrum is an important structure for understanding AF and\\n  successful RF ablations because the tissue in this region is electrically\\n  active and similar to tissue in the LA.\\n\\n  The extent of the pulmonary vein antrum regions in each endocardial\\n  segmentation was estimated using the following criteria.  There are three\\n  subjective guidelines followed when distinguishing between the PV antrum and\\n  the PV itself.\\n\\n  1) If the PV begins to branch, that is a strong indication that you are no\\n  longer in the antrum region.\\n\\n  2) The PV will stop narrowing and the diameter of the vein will remain more\\n  constant when you reach the PV proper.\\n\\n  3) On average, the PV antrum should not extend much more than about 10 mm, or\\n  roughly 3X the thickness of the LA wall.\\n\\n  The LGE-MRI image volumes and their associated left-atrial segmentations are\\n  stored in the NRRD (Nearly-Raw Raster Data) format, which is compatible with\\n  major medical image processing software such as 3D Slicer, Seg3D, ITKSnap,\\n  and other applications built from the Insight Toolkit (www.itk.org).', 'description': 'left_atrium', 'acknowledgement': 'acknowledgement', 'keywords': '', 'contributors': '', 'publications': ''}\n"

The \"Post\" datasets are late-gadolinium\\n enhanced images of the patient heart from 3 to 6 months AFTER RF ablation.\\n\\n Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in the \"Pre\" images is hypothesized to\\n represent fibrosis, or structural remodeling of the endocardial tissue that is\\n correlated with the progression of AF.  Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in\\n the \"Post\" images is due mainly to scarring from the RF ablation.\\n\\n = LATE GADOLINIUM ENHANCED MRI ACQUISITION =\\n\\n  LGE-MRI scans were obtained to assess both the extent of LA fibrosis pre\\n  ablation and the post ablation scarring on LA wall. LGE-MRI scans were\\n  obtained on either a 1.5 Tesla Avanto or a 3.0 Tesla Verio clinical scanner\\n  (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The scan was acquired 15\\n  minutes following contrast agent injection (0.1 mmol/kg, Multihance [Bracco\\n  Diagnostic Inc., Princeton, NJ]) using a 3D inversion recovery, respiration\\n  navigated, ECG-gated, gradient echo pulse sequence. Typical acquisition\\n  parameters were: free-breathing using navigator gating, a transverse imaging\\n  volume with voxel size = 1.25 × 1.25 × 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.625 × 0.625\\n  × 1.25 mm), repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 5.4/2.3 ms, flip angle=20\\n  degrees, inversion time (TI) = 270 - 310 ms, and GRAPPA with R = 2 and 46\\n  reference lines. ECG gating was used to acquire a small subset of phase\\n  encoding views during the diastolic phase of the LA cardiac cycle. The time\\n  interval between the R-peak of the ECG and the start of data acquisition was\\n  defined using the cine images of the LA. The TI value for the LGE-MRI scan\\n  was identified using a scout scan.\\n\\n = LEFT ATRIUM SEGMENTATIONS =\\n\\n  Each dataset (\"Pre\" and \"Post\") includes manual segmentations of (1) the\\n  endocardial surface of the left atrium and (2) the left-atrial wall.  The\\n  endocardial surface segmentation also includes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions.  The left-atrial wall segmentation excludes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions, the mitral valve, and the left-atrial appendage.\\n\\n  The pulmonary vein antrum is an important structure for understanding AF and\\n  successful RF ablations because the tissue in this region is electrically\\n  active and similar to tissue in the LA.\\n\\n  The extent of the pulmonary vein antrum regions in each endocardial\\n  segmentation was estimated using the following criteria.  There are three\\n  subjective guidelines followed when distinguishing between the PV antrum and\\n  the PV itself.\\n\\n  1) If the PV begins to branch, that is a strong indication that you are no\\n  longer in the antrum region.\\n\\n  2) The PV will stop narrowing and the diameter of the vein will remain more\\n  constant when you reach the PV proper.\\n\\n  3) On average, the PV antrum should not extend much more than about 10 mm, or\\n  roughly 3X the thickness of the LA wall.\\n\\n  The LGE-MRI image volumes and their associated left-atrial segmentations are\\n  stored in the NRRD (Nearly-Raw Raster Data) format, which is compatible with\\n  major medical image processing software such as 3D Slicer, Seg3D, ITKSnap,\\n  and other applications built from the Insight Toolkit (www.itk.org).\\n', description='left_atrium', acknowledgement='acknowledgement', keywords='', contributors='', publications=''))\n",

The \"Post\" datasets are late-gadolinium\\n enhanced images of the patient heart from 3 to 6 months AFTER RF ablation.\\n\\n Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in the \"Pre\" images is hypothesized to\\n represent fibrosis, or structural remodeling of the endocardial tissue that is\\n correlated with the progression of AF.  Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in\\n the \"Post\" images is due mainly to scarring from the RF ablation.\\n\\n = LATE GADOLINIUM ENHANCED MRI ACQUISITION =\\n\\n  LGE-MRI scans were obtained to assess both the extent of LA fibrosis pre\\n  ablation and the post ablation scarring on LA wall. LGE-MRI scans were\\n  obtained on either a 1.5 Tesla Avanto or a 3.0 Tesla Verio clinical scanner\\n  (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The scan was acquired 15\\n  minutes following contrast agent injection (0.1 mmol/kg, Multihance [Bracco\\n  Diagnostic Inc., Princeton, NJ]) using a 3D inversion recovery, respiration\\n  navigated, ECG-gated, gradient echo pulse sequence. Typical acquisition\\n  parameters were: free-breathing using navigator gating, a transverse imaging\\n  volume with voxel size = 1.25 × 1.25 × 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.625 × 0.625\\n  × 1.25 mm), repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 5.4/2.3 ms, flip angle=20\\n  degrees, inversion time (TI) = 270 - 310 ms, and GRAPPA with R = 2 and 46\\n  reference lines. ECG gating was used to acquire a small subset of phase\\n  encoding views during the diastolic phase of the LA cardiac cycle. The time\\n  interval between the R-peak of the ECG and the start of data acquisition was\\n  defined using the cine images of the LA. The TI value for the LGE-MRI scan\\n  was identified using a scout scan.\\n\\n = LEFT ATRIUM SEGMENTATIONS =\\n\\n  Each dataset (\"Pre\" and \"Post\") includes manual segmentations of (1) the\\n  endocardial surface of the left atrium and (2) the left-atrial wall.  The\\n  endocardial surface segmentation also includes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions.  The left-atrial wall segmentation excludes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions, the mitral valve, and the left-atrial appendage.\\n\\n  The pulmonary vein antrum is an important structure for understanding AF and\\n  successful RF ablations because the tissue in this region is electrically\\n  active and similar to tissue in the LA.\\n\\n  The extent of the pulmonary vein antrum regions in each endocardial\\n  segmentation was estimated using the following criteria.  There are three\\n  subjective guidelines followed when distinguishing between the PV antrum and\\n  the PV itself.\\n\\n  1) If the PV begins to branch, that is a strong indication that you are no\\n  longer in the antrum region.\\n\\n  2) The PV will stop narrowing and the diameter of the vein will remain more\\n  constant when you reach the PV proper.\\n\\n  3) On average, the PV antrum should not extend much more than about 10 mm, or\\n  roughly 3X the thickness of the LA wall.\\n\\n  The LGE-MRI image volumes and their associated left-atrial segmentations are\\n  stored in the NRRD (Nearly-Raw Raster Data) format, which is compatible with\\n  major medical image processing software such as 3D Slicer, Seg3D, ITKSnap,\\n  and other applications built from the Insight Toolkit (www.itk.org).\\n', description='left_atrium', acknowledgement='acknowledgement', keywords='', contributors='', publications=''))\n"

The \"Post\" datasets are late-gadolinium\\n enhanced images of the patient heart from 3 to 6 months AFTER RF ablation.\\n\\n Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in the \"Pre\" images is hypothesized to\\n represent fibrosis, or structural remodeling of the endocardial tissue that is\\n correlated with the progression of AF.  Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in\\n the \"Post\" images is due mainly to scarring from the RF ablation.\\n\\n = LATE GADOLINIUM ENHANCED MRI ACQUISITION =\\n\\n  LGE-MRI scans were obtained to assess both the extent of LA fibrosis pre\\n  ablation and the post ablation scarring on LA wall. LGE-MRI scans were\\n  obtained on either a 1.5 Tesla Avanto or a 3.0 Tesla Verio clinical scanner\\n  (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The scan was acquired 15\\n  minutes following contrast agent injection (0.1 mmol/kg, Multihance [Bracco\\n  Diagnostic Inc., Princeton, NJ]) using a 3D inversion recovery, respiration\\n  navigated, ECG-gated, gradient echo pulse sequence. Typical acquisition\\n  parameters were: free-breathing using navigator gating, a transverse imaging\\n  volume with voxel size = 1.25 × 1.25 × 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.625 × 0.625\\n  × 1.25 mm), repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 5.4/2.3 ms, flip angle=20\\n  degrees, inversion time (TI) = 270 - 310 ms, and GRAPPA with R = 2 and 46\\n  reference lines. ECG gating was used to acquire a small subset of phase\\n  encoding views during the diastolic phase of the LA cardiac cycle. The time\\n  interval between the R-peak of the ECG and the start of data acquisition was\\n  defined using the cine images of the LA. The TI value for the LGE-MRI scan\\n  was identified using a scout scan.\\n\\n = LEFT ATRIUM SEGMENTATIONS =\\n\\n  Each dataset (\"Pre\" and \"Post\") includes manual segmentations of (1) the\\n  endocardial surface of the left atrium and (2) the left-atrial wall.

The left-atrial wall segmentation excludes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions, the mitral valve, and the left-atrial appendage.\\n\\n  The pulmonary vein antrum is an important structure for understanding AF and\\n  successful RF ablations because the tissue in this region is electrically\\n  active and similar to tissue in the LA.\\n\\n  The extent of the pulmonary vein antrum regions in each endocardial\\n  segmentation was estimated using the following criteria.

The \"Post\" datasets are late-gadolinium\\n enhanced images of the patient heart from 3 to 6 months AFTER RF ablation.\\n\\n Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in the \"Pre\" images is hypothesized to\\n represent fibrosis, or structural remodeling of the endocardial tissue that is\\n correlated with the progression of AF.  Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in\\n the \"Post\" images is due mainly to scarring from the RF ablation.\\n\\n = LATE GADOLINIUM ENHANCED MRI ACQUISITION =\\n\\n  LGE-MRI scans were obtained to assess both the extent of LA fibrosis pre\\n  ablation and the post ablation scarring on LA wall. LGE-MRI scans were\\n  obtained on either a 1.5 Tesla Avanto or a 3.0 Tesla Verio clinical scanner\\n  (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The scan was acquired 15\\n  minutes following contrast agent injection (0.1 mmol/kg, Multihance [Bracco\\n  Diagnostic Inc., Princeton, NJ]) using a 3D inversion recovery, respiration\\n  navigated, ECG-gated, gradient echo pulse sequence. Typical acquisition\\n  parameters were: free-breathing using navigator gating, a transverse imaging\\n  volume with voxel size = 1.25 × 1.25 × 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.625 × 0.625\\n  × 1.25 mm), repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 5.4/2.3 ms, flip angle=20\\n  degrees, inversion time (TI) = 270 - 310 ms, and GRAPPA with R = 2 and 46\\n  reference lines. ECG gating was used to acquire a small subset of phase\\n  encoding views during the diastolic phase of the LA cardiac cycle. The time\\n  interval between the R-peak of the ECG and the start of data acquisition was\\n  defined using the cine images of the LA. The TI value for the LGE-MRI scan\\n  was identified using a scout scan.\\n\\n = LEFT ATRIUM SEGMENTATIONS =\\n\\n  Each dataset (\"Pre\" and \"Post\") includes manual segmentations of (1) the\\n  endocardial surface of the left atrium and (2) the left-atrial wall.  The\\n  endocardial surface segmentation also includes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions.  The left-atrial wall segmentation excludes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions, the mitral valve, and the left-atrial appendage.\\n\\n  The pulmonary vein antrum is an important structure for understanding AF and\\n  successful RF ablations because the tissue in this region is electrically\\n  active and similar to tissue in the LA.\\n\\n  The extent of the pulmonary vein antrum regions in each endocardial\\n  segmentation was estimated using the following criteria.

The \"Post\" datasets are late-gadolinium\\n enhanced images of the patient heart from 3 to 6 months AFTER RF ablation.\\n\\n Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in the \"Pre\" images is hypothesized to\\n represent fibrosis, or structural remodeling of the endocardial tissue that is\\n correlated with the progression of AF.  Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in\\n the \"Post\" images is due mainly to scarring from the RF ablation.\\n\\n = LATE GADOLINIUM ENHANCED MRI ACQUISITION =\\n\\n  LGE-MRI scans were obtained to assess both the extent of LA fibrosis pre\\n  ablation and the post ablation scarring on LA wall. LGE-MRI scans were\\n  obtained on either a 1.5 Tesla Avanto or a 3.0 Tesla Verio clinical scanner\\n  (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The scan was acquired 15\\n  minutes following contrast agent injection (0.1 mmol/kg, Multihance [Bracco\\n  Diagnostic Inc., Princeton, NJ]) using a 3D inversion recovery, respiration\\n  navigated, ECG-gated, gradient echo pulse sequence. Typical acquisition\\n  parameters were: free-breathing using navigator gating, a transverse imaging\\n  volume with voxel size = 1.25 × 1.25 × 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.625 × 0.625\\n  × 1.25 mm), repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 5.4/2.3 ms, flip angle=20\\n  degrees, inversion time (TI) = 270 - 310 ms, and GRAPPA with R = 2 and 46\\n  reference lines. ECG gating was used to acquire a small subset of phase\\n  encoding views during the diastolic phase of the LA cardiac cycle. The time\\n  interval between the R-peak of the ECG and the start of data acquisition was\\n  defined using the cine images of the LA. The TI value for the LGE-MRI scan\\n  was identified using a scout scan.\\n\\n = LEFT ATRIUM SEGMENTATIONS =\\n\\n  Each dataset (\"Pre\" and \"Post\") includes manual segmentations of (1) the\\n  endocardial surface of the left atrium and (2) the left-atrial wall.  The\\n  endocardial surface segmentation also includes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions.  The left-atrial wall segmentation excludes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions, the mitral valve, and the left-atrial appendage.\\n\\n  The pulmonary vein antrum is an important structure for understanding AF and\\n  successful RF ablations because the tissue in this region is electrically\\n  active and similar to tissue in the LA.\\n\\n  The extent of the pulmonary vein antrum regions in each endocardial\\n  segmentation was estimated using the following criteria.  There are three\\n  subjective guidelines followed when distinguishing between the PV antrum and\\n  the PV itself.\\n\\n  1) If the PV begins to branch, that is a strong indication that you are no\\n  longer in the antrum region.\\n\\n  2) The PV will stop narrowing and the diameter of the vein will remain more\\n  constant when you reach the PV proper.\\n\\n  3) On average, the PV antrum should not extend much more than about 10 mm, or\\n  roughly 3X the thickness of the LA wall.\\n\\n  The LGE-MRI image volumes and their associated left-atrial segmentations are\\n  stored in the NRRD (Nearly-Raw Raster Data) format, which is compatible with\\n  major medical image processing software such as 3D Slicer, Seg3D, ITKSnap,\\n  and other applications built from the Insight Toolkit (www.itk.org).\\n', description='left_atrium', acknowledgement='acknowledgement', keywords='', contributors='', publications=''))\n"

The \"Post\" datasets are late-gadolinium\\n enhanced images of the patient heart from 3 to 6 months AFTER RF ablation.\\n\\n Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in the \"Pre\" images is hypothesized to\\n represent fibrosis, or structural remodeling of the endocardial tissue that is\\n correlated with the progression of AF.  Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in\\n the \"Post\" images is due mainly to scarring from the RF ablation.\\n\\n = LATE GADOLINIUM ENHANCED MRI ACQUISITION =\\n\\n  LGE-MRI scans were obtained to assess both the extent of LA fibrosis pre\\n  ablation and the post ablation scarring on LA wall. LGE-MRI scans were\\n  obtained on either a 1.5 Tesla Avanto or a 3.0 Tesla Verio clinical scanner\\n  (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The scan was acquired 15\\n  minutes following contrast agent injection (0.1 mmol/kg, Multihance [Bracco\\n  Diagnostic Inc., Princeton, NJ]) using a 3D inversion recovery, respiration\\n  navigated, ECG-gated, gradient echo pulse sequence. Typical acquisition\\n  parameters were: free-breathing using navigator gating, a transverse imaging\\n  volume with voxel size = 1.25 × 1.25 × 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.625 × 0.625\\n  × 1.25 mm), repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 5.4/2.3 ms, flip angle=20\\n  degrees, inversion time (TI) = 270 - 310 ms, and GRAPPA with R = 2 and 46\\n  reference lines. ECG gating was used to acquire a small subset of phase\\n  encoding views during the diastolic phase of the LA cardiac cycle. The time\\n  interval between the R-peak of the ECG and the start of data acquisition was\\n  defined using the cine images of the LA. The TI value for the LGE-MRI scan\\n  was identified using a scout scan.\\n\\n = LEFT ATRIUM SEGMENTATIONS =\\n\\n  Each dataset (\"Pre\" and \"Post\") includes manual segmentations of (1) the\\n  endocardial surface of the left atrium and (2) the left-atrial wall.  The\\n  endocardial surface segmentation also includes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions.  The left-atrial wall segmentation excludes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions, the mitral valve, and the left-atrial appendage.\\n\\n  The pulmonary vein antrum is an important structure for understanding AF and\\n  successful RF ablations because the tissue in this region is electrically\\n  active and similar to tissue in the LA.\\n\\n  The extent of the pulmonary vein antrum regions in each endocardial\\n  segmentation was estimated using the following criteria.  There are three\\n  subjective guidelines followed when distinguishing between the PV antrum and\\n  the PV itself.\\n\\n  1) If the PV begins to branch, that is a strong indication that you are no\\n  longer in the antrum region.\\n\\n  2) The PV will stop narrowing and the diameter of the vein will remain more\\n  constant when you reach the PV proper.\\n\\n  3) On average, the PV antrum should not extend much more than about 10 mm, or\\n  roughly 3X the thickness of the LA wall.\\n\\n  The LGE-MRI image volumes and their associated left-atrial segmentations are\\n  stored in the NRRD (Nearly-Raw Raster Data) format, which is compatible with\\n  major medical image processing software such as 3D Slicer, Seg3D, ITKSnap,\\n  and other applications built from the Insight Toolkit (www.itk.org).\\n', description='left_atrium', acknowledgement='acknowledgement', keywords='', contributors='', publications='')\n",

The \"Post\" datasets are late-gadolinium\\n enhanced images of the patient heart from 3 to 6 months AFTER RF ablation.\\n\\n Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in the \"Pre\" images is hypothesized to\\n represent fibrosis, or structural remodeling of the endocardial tissue that is\\n correlated with the progression of AF.  Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in\\n the \"Post\" images is due mainly to scarring from the RF ablation.\\n\\n = LATE GADOLINIUM ENHANCED MRI ACQUISITION =\\n\\n  LGE-MRI scans were obtained to assess both the extent of LA fibrosis pre\\n  ablation and the post ablation scarring on LA wall. LGE-MRI scans were\\n  obtained on either a 1.5 Tesla Avanto or a 3.0 Tesla Verio clinical scanner\\n  (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The scan was acquired 15\\n  minutes following contrast agent injection (0.1 mmol/kg, Multihance [Bracco\\n  Diagnostic Inc., Princeton, NJ]) using a 3D inversion recovery, respiration\\n  navigated, ECG-gated, gradient echo pulse sequence. Typical acquisition\\n  parameters were: free-breathing using navigator gating, a transverse imaging\\n  volume with voxel size = 1.25 × 1.25 × 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.625 × 0.625\\n  × 1.25 mm), repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 5.4/2.3 ms, flip angle=20\\n  degrees, inversion time (TI) = 270 - 310 ms, and GRAPPA with R = 2 and 46\\n  reference lines. ECG gating was used to acquire a small subset of phase\\n  encoding views during the diastolic phase of the LA cardiac cycle. The time\\n  interval between the R-peak of the ECG and the start of data acquisition was\\n  defined using the cine images of the LA. The TI value for the LGE-MRI scan\\n  was identified using a scout scan.\\n\\n = LEFT ATRIUM SEGMENTATIONS =\\n\\n  Each dataset (\"Pre\" and \"Post\") includes manual segmentations of (1) the\\n  endocardial surface of the left atrium and (2) the left-atrial wall.  The\\n  endocardial surface segmentation also includes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions.  The left-atrial wall segmentation excludes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions, the mitral valve, and the left-atrial appendage.\\n\\n  The pulmonary vein antrum is an important structure for understanding AF and\\n  successful RF ablations because the tissue in this region is electrically\\n  active and similar to tissue in the LA.\\n\\n  The extent of the pulmonary vein antrum regions in each endocardial\\n  segmentation was estimated using the following criteria.  There are three\\n  subjective guidelines followed when distinguishing between the PV antrum and\\n  the PV itself.\\n\\n  1) If the PV begins to branch, that is a strong indication that you are no\\n  longer in the antrum region.\\n\\n  2) The PV will stop narrowing and the diameter of the vein will remain more\\n  constant when you reach the PV proper.\\n\\n  3) On average, the PV antrum should not extend much more than about 10 mm, or\\n  roughly 3X the thickness of the LA wall.\\n\\n  The LGE-MRI image volumes and their associated left-atrial segmentations are\\n  stored in the NRRD (Nearly-Raw Raster Data) format, which is compatible with\\n  major medical image processing software such as 3D Slicer, Seg3D, ITKSnap,\\n  and other applications built from the Insight Toolkit (www.itk.org).\\n', description='left_atrium', acknowledgement='acknowledgement', keywords='', contributors='', publications=''))), GroomedSegmentation(id=1060, file=<swcc.models.FileType object at 0x7f1b90e65e20>, pre_cropping=None, pre_alignment=None, segmentation=Segmentation(id=1060, file=<swcc.models.FileType object at 0x7f1b90ea6310>, anatomy_type='unknown', subject=Subject(id=766, name='CARMA1189.laendo_no_veins', dataset=Dataset(id=90, name='left_atrium-1', license='=== NAMIC: CARMA Left Atrial MRI ===\\n\\nIf you use ShapeWorks in work that leads to published research, we humbly ask that you to cite ShapeWorks, add the following to the \\'Acknowledgments\\' section of your paper:\\n\\n\"The National Institutes of Health supported this work under grant numbers NIBIB-U24EB029011, NIAMS-R01AR076120, NHLBI-R01HL135568, NIBIB-R01EB016701, and NIGMS-P41GM103545.\"\\n\\nand add the following \\'disclaimer\\':\\n\\n\"The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.\"\\n\\n\\nWhen referencing ShapeWorks, please include a bibliographical reference to the paper below, and, if possible, include a link to shapeworks.sci.utah.edu.\\n\\nJoshua Cates, Shireen Elhabian, Ross Whitaker. \"Shapeworks: particle-based shape correspondence and visualization software.\" Statistical Shape and Deformation Analysis.

The \"Post\" datasets are late-gadolinium\\n enhanced images of the patient heart from 3 to 6 months AFTER RF ablation.\\n\\n Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in the \"Pre\" images is hypothesized to\\n represent fibrosis, or structural remodeling of the endocardial tissue that is\\n correlated with the progression of AF.  Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in\\n the \"Post\" images is due mainly to scarring from the RF ablation.\\n\\n = LATE GADOLINIUM ENHANCED MRI ACQUISITION =\\n\\n  LGE-MRI scans were obtained to assess both the extent of LA fibrosis pre\\n  ablation and the post ablation scarring on LA wall. LGE-MRI scans were\\n  obtained on either a 1.5 Tesla Avanto or a 3.0 Tesla Verio clinical scanner\\n  (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The scan was acquired 15\\n  minutes following contrast agent injection (0.1 mmol/kg, Multihance [Bracco\\n  Diagnostic Inc., Princeton, NJ]) using a 3D inversion recovery, respiration\\n  navigated, ECG-gated, gradient echo pulse sequence. Typical acquisition\\n  parameters were: free-breathing using navigator gating, a transverse imaging\\n  volume with voxel size = 1.25 × 1.25 × 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.625 × 0.625\\n  × 1.25 mm), repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 5.4/2.3 ms, flip angle=20\\n  degrees, inversion time (TI) = 270 - 310 ms, and GRAPPA with R = 2 and 46\\n  reference lines. ECG gating was used to acquire a small subset of phase\\n  encoding views during the diastolic phase of the LA cardiac cycle. The time\\n  interval between the R-peak of the ECG and the start of data acquisition was\\n  defined using the cine images of the LA. The TI value for the LGE-MRI scan\\n  was identified using a scout scan.\\n\\n = LEFT ATRIUM SEGMENTATIONS =\\n\\n  Each dataset (\"Pre\" and \"Post\") includes manual segmentations of (1) the\\n  endocardial surface of the left atrium and (2) the left-atrial wall.

The left-atrial wall segmentation excludes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions, the mitral valve, and the left-atrial appendage.\\n\\n  The pulmonary vein antrum is an important structure for understanding AF and\\n  successful RF ablations because the tissue in this region is electrically\\n  active and similar to tissue in the LA.\\n\\n  The extent of the pulmonary vein antrum regions in each endocardial\\n  segmentation was estimated using the following criteria.

The \"Post\" datasets are late-gadolinium\\n enhanced images of the patient heart from 3 to 6 months AFTER RF ablation.\\n\\n Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in the \"Pre\" images is hypothesized to\\n represent fibrosis, or structural remodeling of the endocardial tissue that is\\n correlated with the progression of AF.  Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in\\n the \"Post\" images is due mainly to scarring from the RF ablation.\\n\\n = LATE GADOLINIUM ENHANCED MRI ACQUISITION =\\n\\n  LGE-MRI scans were obtained to assess both the extent of LA fibrosis pre\\n  ablation and the post ablation scarring on LA wall. LGE-MRI scans were\\n  obtained on either a 1.5 Tesla Avanto or a 3.0 Tesla Verio clinical scanner\\n  (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The scan was acquired 15\\n  minutes following contrast agent injection (0.1 mmol/kg, Multihance [Bracco\\n  Diagnostic Inc., Princeton, NJ]) using a 3D inversion recovery, respiration\\n  navigated, ECG-gated, gradient echo pulse sequence. Typical acquisition\\n  parameters were: free-breathing using navigator gating, a transverse imaging\\n  volume with voxel size = 1.25 × 1.25 × 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.625 × 0.625\\n  × 1.25 mm), repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 5.4/2.3 ms, flip angle=20\\n  degrees, inversion time (TI) = 270 - 310 ms, and GRAPPA with R = 2 and 46\\n  reference lines. ECG gating was used to acquire a small subset of phase\\n  encoding views during the diastolic phase of the LA cardiac cycle. The time\\n  interval between the R-peak of the ECG and the start of data acquisition was\\n  defined using the cine images of the LA. The TI value for the LGE-MRI scan\\n  was identified using a scout scan.\\n\\n = LEFT ATRIUM SEGMENTATIONS =\\n\\n  Each dataset (\"Pre\" and \"Post\") includes manual segmentations of (1) the\\n  endocardial surface of the left atrium and (2) the left-atrial wall.  The\\n  endocardial surface segmentation also includes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions.  The left-atrial wall segmentation excludes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions, the mitral valve, and the left-atrial appendage.\\n\\n  The pulmonary vein antrum is an important structure for understanding AF and\\n  successful RF ablations because the tissue in this region is electrically\\n  active and similar to tissue in the LA.\\n\\n  The extent of the pulmonary vein antrum regions in each endocardial\\n  segmentation was estimated using the following criteria.  There are three\\n  subjective guidelines followed when distinguishing between the PV antrum and\\n  the PV itself.\\n\\n  1) If the PV begins to branch, that is a strong indication that you are no\\n  longer in the antrum region.\\n\\n  2) The PV will stop narrowing and the diameter of the vein will remain more\\n  constant when you reach the PV proper.\\n\\n  3) On average, the PV antrum should not extend much more than about 10 mm, or\\n  roughly 3X the thickness of the LA wall.\\n\\n  The LGE-MRI image volumes and their associated left-atrial segmentations are\\n  stored in the NRRD (Nearly-Raw Raster Data) format, which is compatible with\\n  major medical image processing software such as 3D Slicer, Seg3D, ITKSnap,\\n  and other applications built from the Insight Toolkit (www.itk.org).\\n', description='left_atrium', acknowledgement='acknowledgement', keywords='', contributors='', publications=''))), GroomedSegmentation(id=1041, file=<swcc.models.FileType object at 0x7f1b90dd9d90>, pre_cropping=None, pre_alignment=None, segmentation=Segmentation(id=1041, file=<swcc.models.FileType object at 0x7f1b90dd9e50>, anatomy_type='unknown', subject=Subject(id=747, name='CARMA0643.laendo_no_veins', dataset=Dataset(id=90, name='left_atrium-1', license='=== NAMIC: CARMA Left Atrial MRI ===\\n\\nIf you use ShapeWorks in work that leads to published research, we humbly ask that you to cite ShapeWorks, add the following to the \\'Acknowledgments\\' section of your paper:\\n\\n\"The National Institutes of Health supported this work under grant numbers NIBIB-U24EB029011, NIAMS-R01AR076120, NHLBI-R01HL135568, NIBIB-R01EB016701, and NIGMS-P41GM103545.\"\\n\\nand add the following \\'disclaimer\\':\\n\\n\"The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.\"\\n\\n\\nWhen referencing ShapeWorks, please include a bibliographical reference to the paper below, and, if possible, include a link to shapeworks.sci.utah.edu.\\n\\nJoshua Cates, Shireen Elhabian, Ross Whitaker. \"Shapeworks: particle-based shape correspondence and visualization software.\" Statistical Shape and Deformation Analysis.

The \"Post\" datasets are late-gadolinium\\n enhanced images of the patient heart from 3 to 6 months AFTER RF ablation.\\n\\n Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in the \"Pre\" images is hypothesized to\\n represent fibrosis, or structural remodeling of the endocardial tissue that is\\n correlated with the progression of AF.  Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in\\n the \"Post\" images is due mainly to scarring from the RF ablation.\\n\\n = LATE GADOLINIUM ENHANCED MRI ACQUISITION =\\n\\n  LGE-MRI scans were obtained to assess both the extent of LA fibrosis pre\\n  ablation and the post ablation scarring on LA wall. LGE-MRI scans were\\n  obtained on either a 1.5 Tesla Avanto or a 3.0 Tesla Verio clinical scanner\\n  (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The scan was acquired 15\\n  minutes following contrast agent injection (0.1 mmol/kg, Multihance [Bracco\\n  Diagnostic Inc., Princeton, NJ]) using a 3D inversion recovery, respiration\\n  navigated, ECG-gated, gradient echo pulse sequence. Typical acquisition\\n  parameters were: free-breathing using navigator gating, a transverse imaging\\n  volume with voxel size = 1.25 × 1.25 × 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.625 × 0.625\\n  × 1.25 mm), repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 5.4/2.3 ms, flip angle=20\\n  degrees, inversion time (TI) = 270 - 310 ms, and GRAPPA with R = 2 and 46\\n  reference lines. ECG gating was used to acquire a small subset of phase\\n  encoding views during the diastolic phase of the LA cardiac cycle. The time\\n  interval between the R-peak of the ECG and the start of data acquisition was\\n  defined using the cine images of the LA. The TI value for the LGE-MRI scan\\n  was identified using a scout scan.\\n\\n = LEFT ATRIUM SEGMENTATIONS =\\n\\n  Each dataset (\"Pre\" and \"Post\") includes manual segmentations of (1) the\\n  endocardial surface of the left atrium and (2) the left-atrial wall.

The left-atrial wall segmentation excludes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions, the mitral valve, and the left-atrial appendage.\\n\\n  The pulmonary vein antrum is an important structure for understanding AF and\\n  successful RF ablations because the tissue in this region is electrically\\n  active and similar to tissue in the LA.\\n\\n  The extent of the pulmonary vein antrum regions in each endocardial\\n  segmentation was estimated using the following criteria.

The \"Post\" datasets are late-gadolinium\\n enhanced images of the patient heart from 3 to 6 months AFTER RF ablation.\\n\\n Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in the \"Pre\" images is hypothesized to\\n represent fibrosis, or structural remodeling of the endocardial tissue that is\\n correlated with the progression of AF.  Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in\\n the \"Post\" images is due mainly to scarring from the RF ablation.\\n\\n = LATE GADOLINIUM ENHANCED MRI ACQUISITION =\\n\\n  LGE-MRI scans were obtained to assess both the extent of LA fibrosis pre\\n  ablation and the post ablation scarring on LA wall. LGE-MRI scans were\\n  obtained on either a 1.5 Tesla Avanto or a 3.0 Tesla Verio clinical scanner\\n  (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The scan was acquired 15\\n  minutes following contrast agent injection (0.1 mmol/kg, Multihance [Bracco\\n  Diagnostic Inc., Princeton, NJ]) using a 3D inversion recovery, respiration\\n  navigated, ECG-gated, gradient echo pulse sequence. Typical acquisition\\n  parameters were: free-breathing using navigator gating, a transverse imaging\\n  volume with voxel size = 1.25 × 1.25 × 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.625 × 0.625\\n  × 1.25 mm), repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 5.4/2.3 ms, flip angle=20\\n  degrees, inversion time (TI) = 270 - 310 ms, and GRAPPA with R = 2 and 46\\n  reference lines. ECG gating was used to acquire a small subset of phase\\n  encoding views during the diastolic phase of the LA cardiac cycle. The time\\n  interval between the R-peak of the ECG and the start of data acquisition was\\n  defined using the cine images of the LA. The TI value for the LGE-MRI scan\\n  was identified using a scout scan.\\n\\n = LEFT ATRIUM SEGMENTATIONS =\\n\\n  Each dataset (\"Pre\" and \"Post\") includes manual segmentations of (1) the\\n  endocardial surface of the left atrium and (2) the left-atrial wall.  The\\n  endocardial surface segmentation also includes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions.  The left-atrial wall segmentation excludes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions, the mitral valve, and the left-atrial appendage.\\n\\n  The pulmonary vein antrum is an important structure for understanding AF and\\n  successful RF ablations because the tissue in this region is electrically\\n  active and similar to tissue in the LA.\\n\\n  The extent of the pulmonary vein antrum regions in each endocardial\\n  segmentation was estimated using the following criteria.  There are three\\n  subjective guidelines followed when distinguishing between the PV antrum and\\n  the PV itself.\\n\\n  1) If the PV begins to branch, that is a strong indication that you are no\\n  longer in the antrum region.\\n\\n  2) The PV will stop narrowing and the diameter of the vein will remain more\\n  constant when you reach the PV proper.\\n\\n  3) On average, the PV antrum should not extend much more than about 10 mm, or\\n  roughly 3X the thickness of the LA wall.\\n\\n  The LGE-MRI image volumes and their associated left-atrial segmentations are\\n  stored in the NRRD (Nearly-Raw Raster Data) format, which is compatible with\\n  major medical image processing software such as 3D Slicer, Seg3D, ITKSnap,\\n  and other applications built from the Insight Toolkit (www.itk.org).\\n', description='left_atrium', acknowledgement='acknowledgement', keywords='', contributors='', publications=''))), GroomedSegmentation(id=1074, file=<swcc.models.FileType object at 0x7f1b90de8520>, pre_cropping=None, pre_alignment=None, segmentation=Segmentation(id=1074, file=<swcc.models.FileType object at 0x7f1b90de8220>, anatomy_type='unknown', subject=Subject(id=780, name='CARMA1401.laendo_no_veins', dataset=Dataset(id=90, name='left_atrium-1', license='=== NAMIC: CARMA Left Atrial MRI ===\\n\\nIf you use ShapeWorks in work that leads to published research, we humbly ask that you to cite ShapeWorks, add the following to the \\'Acknowledgments\\' section of your paper:\\n\\n\"The National Institutes of Health supported this work under grant numbers NIBIB-U24EB029011, NIAMS-R01AR076120, NHLBI-R01HL135568, NIBIB-R01EB016701, and NIGMS-P41GM103545.\"\\n\\nand add the following \\'disclaimer\\':\\n\\n\"The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.\"\\n\\n\\nWhen referencing ShapeWorks, please include a bibliographical reference to the paper below, and, if possible, include a link to shapeworks.sci.utah.edu.\\n\\nJoshua Cates, Shireen Elhabian, Ross Whitaker. \"Shapeworks: particle-based shape correspondence and visualization software.\" Statistical Shape and Deformation Analysis.

The \"Post\" datasets are late-gadolinium\\n enhanced images of the patient heart from 3 to 6 months AFTER RF ablation.\\n\\n Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in the \"Pre\" images is hypothesized to\\n represent fibrosis, or structural remodeling of the endocardial tissue that is\\n correlated with the progression of AF.  Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in\\n the \"Post\" images is due mainly to scarring from the RF ablation.\\n\\n = LATE GADOLINIUM ENHANCED MRI ACQUISITION =\\n\\n  LGE-MRI scans were obtained to assess both the extent of LA fibrosis pre\\n  ablation and the post ablation scarring on LA wall. LGE-MRI scans were\\n  obtained on either a 1.5 Tesla Avanto or a 3.0 Tesla Verio clinical scanner\\n  (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The scan was acquired 15\\n  minutes following contrast agent injection (0.1 mmol/kg, Multihance [Bracco\\n  Diagnostic Inc., Princeton, NJ]) using a 3D inversion recovery, respiration\\n  navigated, ECG-gated, gradient echo pulse sequence. Typical acquisition\\n  parameters were: free-breathing using navigator gating, a transverse imaging\\n  volume with voxel size = 1.25 × 1.25 × 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.625 × 0.625\\n  × 1.25 mm), repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 5.4/2.3 ms, flip angle=20\\n  degrees, inversion time (TI) = 270 - 310 ms, and GRAPPA with R = 2 and 46\\n  reference lines. ECG gating was used to acquire a small subset of phase\\n  encoding views during the diastolic phase of the LA cardiac cycle. The time\\n  interval between the R-peak of the ECG and the start of data acquisition was\\n  defined using the cine images of the LA. The TI value for the LGE-MRI scan\\n  was identified using a scout scan.\\n\\n = LEFT ATRIUM SEGMENTATIONS =\\n\\n  Each dataset (\"Pre\" and \"Post\") includes manual segmentations of (1) the\\n  endocardial surface of the left atrium and (2) the left-atrial wall.

The left-atrial wall segmentation excludes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions, the mitral valve, and the left-atrial appendage.\\n\\n  The pulmonary vein antrum is an important structure for understanding AF and\\n  successful RF ablations because the tissue in this region is electrically\\n  active and similar to tissue in the LA.\\n\\n  The extent of the pulmonary vein antrum regions in each endocardial\\n  segmentation was estimated using the following criteria.

The \"Post\" datasets are late-gadolinium\\n enhanced images of the patient heart from 3 to 6 months AFTER RF ablation.\\n\\n Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in the \"Pre\" images is hypothesized to\\n represent fibrosis, or structural remodeling of the endocardial tissue that is\\n correlated with the progression of AF.  Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in\\n the \"Post\" images is due mainly to scarring from the RF ablation.\\n\\n = LATE GADOLINIUM ENHANCED MRI ACQUISITION =\\n\\n  LGE-MRI scans were obtained to assess both the extent of LA fibrosis pre\\n  ablation and the post ablation scarring on LA wall. LGE-MRI scans were\\n  obtained on either a 1.5 Tesla Avanto or a 3.0 Tesla Verio clinical scanner\\n  (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The scan was acquired 15\\n  minutes following contrast agent injection (0.1 mmol/kg, Multihance [Bracco\\n  Diagnostic Inc., Princeton, NJ]) using a 3D inversion recovery, respiration\\n  navigated, ECG-gated, gradient echo pulse sequence. Typical acquisition\\n  parameters were: free-breathing using navigator gating, a transverse imaging\\n  volume with voxel size = 1.25 × 1.25 × 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.625 × 0.625\\n  × 1.25 mm), repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 5.4/2.3 ms, flip angle=20\\n  degrees, inversion time (TI) = 270 - 310 ms, and GRAPPA with R = 2 and 46\\n  reference lines. ECG gating was used to acquire a small subset of phase\\n  encoding views during the diastolic phase of the LA cardiac cycle. The time\\n  interval between the R-peak of the ECG and the start of data acquisition was\\n  defined using the cine images of the LA. The TI value for the LGE-MRI scan\\n  was identified using a scout scan.\\n\\n = LEFT ATRIUM SEGMENTATIONS =\\n\\n  Each dataset (\"Pre\" and \"Post\") includes manual segmentations of (1) the\\n  endocardial surface of the left atrium and (2) the left-atrial wall.  The\\n  endocardial surface segmentation also includes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions.  The left-atrial wall segmentation excludes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions, the mitral valve, and the left-atrial appendage.\\n\\n  The pulmonary vein antrum is an important structure for understanding AF and\\n  successful RF ablations because the tissue in this region is electrically\\n  active and similar to tissue in the LA.\\n\\n  The extent of the pulmonary vein antrum regions in each endocardial\\n  segmentation was estimated using the following criteria.  There are three\\n  subjective guidelines followed when distinguishing between the PV antrum and\\n  the PV itself.\\n\\n  1) If the PV begins to branch, that is a strong indication that you are no\\n  longer in the antrum region.\\n\\n  2) The PV will stop narrowing and the diameter of the vein will remain more\\n  constant when you reach the PV proper.\\n\\n  3) On average, the PV antrum should not extend much more than about 10 mm, or\\n  roughly 3X the thickness of the LA wall.\\n\\n  The LGE-MRI image volumes and their associated left-atrial segmentations are\\n  stored in the NRRD (Nearly-Raw Raster Data) format, which is compatible with\\n  major medical image processing software such as 3D Slicer, Seg3D, ITKSnap,\\n  and other applications built from the Insight Toolkit (www.itk.org).\\n', description='left_atrium', acknowledgement='acknowledgement', keywords='', contributors='', publications=''))), GroomedSegmentation(id=1061, file=<swcc.models.FileType object at 0x7f1b90da63d0>, pre_cropping=None, pre_alignment=None, segmentation=Segmentation(id=1061, file=<swcc.models.FileType object at 0x7f1b90d7f640>, anatomy_type='unknown', subject=Subject(id=767, name='CARMA1208.laendo_no_veins', dataset=Dataset(id=90, name='left_atrium-1', license='=== NAMIC: CARMA Left Atrial MRI ===\\n\\nIf you use ShapeWorks in work that leads to published research, we humbly ask that you to cite ShapeWorks, add the following to the \\'Acknowledgments\\' section of your paper:\\n\\n\"The National Institutes of Health supported this work under grant numbers NIBIB-U24EB029011, NIAMS-R01AR076120, NHLBI-R01HL135568, NIBIB-R01EB016701, and NIGMS-P41GM103545.\"\\n\\nand add the following \\'disclaimer\\':\\n\\n\"The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.\"\\n\\n\\nWhen referencing ShapeWorks, please include a bibliographical reference to the paper below, and, if possible, include a link to shapeworks.sci.utah.edu.\\n\\nJoshua Cates, Shireen Elhabian, Ross Whitaker. \"Shapeworks: particle-based shape correspondence and visualization software.\" Statistical Shape and Deformation Analysis.

The \"Post\" datasets are late-gadolinium\\n enhanced images of the patient heart from 3 to 6 months AFTER RF ablation.\\n\\n Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in the \"Pre\" images is hypothesized to\\n represent fibrosis, or structural remodeling of the endocardial tissue that is\\n correlated with the progression of AF.  Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in\\n the \"Post\" images is due mainly to scarring from the RF ablation.\\n\\n = LATE GADOLINIUM ENHANCED MRI ACQUISITION =\\n\\n  LGE-MRI scans were obtained to assess both the extent of LA fibrosis pre\\n  ablation and the post ablation scarring on LA wall. LGE-MRI scans were\\n  obtained on either a 1.5 Tesla Avanto or a 3.0 Tesla Verio clinical scanner\\n  (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The scan was acquired 15\\n  minutes following contrast agent injection (0.1 mmol/kg, Multihance [Bracco\\n  Diagnostic Inc., Princeton, NJ]) using a 3D inversion recovery, respiration\\n  navigated, ECG-gated, gradient echo pulse sequence. Typical acquisition\\n  parameters were: free-breathing using navigator gating, a transverse imaging\\n  volume with voxel size = 1.25 × 1.25 × 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.625 × 0.625\\n  × 1.25 mm), repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 5.4/2.3 ms, flip angle=20\\n  degrees, inversion time (TI) = 270 - 310 ms, and GRAPPA with R = 2 and 46\\n  reference lines. ECG gating was used to acquire a small subset of phase\\n  encoding views during the diastolic phase of the LA cardiac cycle. The time\\n  interval between the R-peak of the ECG and the start of data acquisition was\\n  defined using the cine images of the LA. The TI value for the LGE-MRI scan\\n  was identified using a scout scan.\\n\\n = LEFT ATRIUM SEGMENTATIONS =\\n\\n  Each dataset (\"Pre\" and \"Post\") includes manual segmentations of (1) the\\n  endocardial surface of the left atrium and (2) the left-atrial wall.

The left-atrial wall segmentation excludes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions, the mitral valve, and the left-atrial appendage.\\n\\n  The pulmonary vein antrum is an important structure for understanding AF and\\n  successful RF ablations because the tissue in this region is electrically\\n  active and similar to tissue in the LA.\\n\\n  The extent of the pulmonary vein antrum regions in each endocardial\\n  segmentation was estimated using the following criteria.

The \"Post\" datasets are late-gadolinium\\n enhanced images of the patient heart from 3 to 6 months AFTER RF ablation.\\n\\n Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in the \"Pre\" images is hypothesized to\\n represent fibrosis, or structural remodeling of the endocardial tissue that is\\n correlated with the progression of AF.  Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in\\n the \"Post\" images is due mainly to scarring from the RF ablation.\\n\\n = LATE GADOLINIUM ENHANCED MRI ACQUISITION =\\n\\n  LGE-MRI scans were obtained to assess both the extent of LA fibrosis pre\\n  ablation and the post ablation scarring on LA wall. LGE-MRI scans were\\n  obtained on either a 1.5 Tesla Avanto or a 3.0 Tesla Verio clinical scanner\\n  (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The scan was acquired 15\\n  minutes following contrast agent injection (0.1 mmol/kg, Multihance [Bracco\\n  Diagnostic Inc., Princeton, NJ]) using a 3D inversion recovery, respiration\\n  navigated, ECG-gated, gradient echo pulse sequence. Typical acquisition\\n  parameters were: free-breathing using navigator gating, a transverse imaging\\n  volume with voxel size = 1.25 × 1.25 × 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.625 × 0.625\\n  × 1.25 mm), repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 5.4/2.3 ms, flip angle=20\\n  degrees, inversion time (TI) = 270 - 310 ms, and GRAPPA with R = 2 and 46\\n  reference lines. ECG gating was used to acquire a small subset of phase\\n  encoding views during the diastolic phase of the LA cardiac cycle. The time\\n  interval between the R-peak of the ECG and the start of data acquisition was\\n  defined using the cine images of the LA. The TI value for the LGE-MRI scan\\n  was identified using a scout scan.\\n\\n = LEFT ATRIUM SEGMENTATIONS =\\n\\n  Each dataset (\"Pre\" and \"Post\") includes manual segmentations of (1) the\\n  endocardial surface of the left atrium and (2) the left-atrial wall.  The\\n  endocardial surface segmentation also includes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions.  The left-atrial wall segmentation excludes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions, the mitral valve, and the left-atrial appendage.\\n\\n  The pulmonary vein antrum is an important structure for understanding AF and\\n  successful RF ablations because the tissue in this region is electrically\\n  active and similar to tissue in the LA.\\n\\n  The extent of the pulmonary vein antrum regions in each endocardial\\n  segmentation was estimated using the following criteria.  There are three\\n  subjective guidelines followed when distinguishing between the PV antrum and\\n  the PV itself.\\n\\n  1) If the PV begins to branch, that is a strong indication that you are no\\n  longer in the antrum region.\\n\\n  2) The PV will stop narrowing and the diameter of the vein will remain more\\n  constant when you reach the PV proper.\\n\\n  3) On average, the PV antrum should not extend much more than about 10 mm, or\\n  roughly 3X the thickness of the LA wall.\\n\\n  The LGE-MRI image volumes and their associated left-atrial segmentations are\\n  stored in the NRRD (Nearly-Raw Raster Data) format, which is compatible with\\n  major medical image processing software such as 3D Slicer, Seg3D, ITKSnap,\\n  and other applications built from the Insight Toolkit (www.itk.org).\\n', description='left_atrium', acknowledgement='acknowledgement', keywords='', contributors='', publications=''))), GroomedSegmentation(id=1044, file=<swcc.models.FileType object at 0x7f1b90d472b0>, pre_cropping=None, pre_alignment=None, segmentation=Segmentation(id=1044, file=<swcc.models.FileType object at 0x7f1b90d474f0>, anatomy_type='unknown', subject=Subject(id=750, name='CARMA0937.laendo_no_veins', dataset=Dataset(id=90, name='left_atrium-1', license='=== NAMIC: CARMA Left Atrial MRI ===\\n\\nIf you use ShapeWorks in work that leads to published research, we humbly ask that you to cite ShapeWorks, add the following to the \\'Acknowledgments\\' section of your paper:\\n\\n\"The National Institutes of Health supported this work under grant numbers NIBIB-U24EB029011, NIAMS-R01AR076120, NHLBI-R01HL135568, NIBIB-R01EB016701, and NIGMS-P41GM103545.\"\\n\\nand add the following \\'disclaimer\\':\\n\\n\"The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.\"\\n\\n\\nWhen referencing ShapeWorks, please include a bibliographical reference to the paper below, and, if possible, include a link to shapeworks.sci.utah.edu.\\n\\nJoshua Cates, Shireen Elhabian, Ross Whitaker. \"Shapeworks: particle-based shape correspondence and visualization software.\" Statistical Shape and Deformation Analysis.

The \"Post\" datasets are late-gadolinium\\n enhanced images of the patient heart from 3 to 6 months AFTER RF ablation.\\n\\n Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in the \"Pre\" images is hypothesized to\\n represent fibrosis, or structural remodeling of the endocardial tissue that is\\n correlated with the progression of AF.  Enhancement in the left-atrial wall in\\n the \"Post\" images is due mainly to scarring from the RF ablation.\\n\\n = LATE GADOLINIUM ENHANCED MRI ACQUISITION =\\n\\n  LGE-MRI scans were obtained to assess both the extent of LA fibrosis pre\\n  ablation and the post ablation scarring on LA wall. LGE-MRI scans were\\n  obtained on either a 1.5 Tesla Avanto or a 3.0 Tesla Verio clinical scanner\\n  (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The scan was acquired 15\\n  minutes following contrast agent injection (0.1 mmol/kg, Multihance [Bracco\\n  Diagnostic Inc., Princeton, NJ]) using a 3D inversion recovery, respiration\\n  navigated, ECG-gated, gradient echo pulse sequence. Typical acquisition\\n  parameters were: free-breathing using navigator gating, a transverse imaging\\n  volume with voxel size = 1.25 × 1.25 × 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.625 × 0.625\\n  × 1.25 mm), repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 5.4/2.3 ms, flip angle=20\\n  degrees, inversion time (TI) = 270 - 310 ms, and GRAPPA with R = 2 and 46\\n  reference lines. ECG gating was used to acquire a small subset of phase\\n  encoding views during the diastolic phase of the LA cardiac cycle. The time\\n  interval between the R-peak of the ECG and the start of data acquisition was\\n  defined using the cine images of the LA. The TI value for the LGE-MRI scan\\n  was identified using a scout scan.\\n\\n = LEFT ATRIUM SEGMENTATIONS =\\n\\n  Each dataset (\"Pre\" and \"Post\") includes manual segmentations of (1) the\\n  endocardial surface of the left atrium and (2) the left-atrial wall.

The left-atrial wall segmentation excludes the pulmonary vein antrum\\n  regions, the mitral valve, and the left-atrial appendage.\\n\\n  The pulmonary vein antrum is an important structure for understanding AF and\\n  successful RF ablations because the tissue in this region is electrically\\n  active and similar to tissue in the LA.\\n\\n  The extent of the pulmonary vein antrum regions in each endocardial\\n  segmentation was estimated using the following criteria.

There are three\\n  subjective guidelines followed when distinguishing between the PV antrum and\\n  the PV itself.\\n\\n  1) If the PV begins to branch, that is a strong indication that you are no\\n  longer in the antrum region.\\n\\n  2) The PV will stop narrowing and the diameter of the vein will remain more\\n  constant when you reach the PV proper.\\n\\n  3) On average, the PV antrum should not extend much more than about 10 mm, or\\n  roughly 3X the thickness of the LA wall.\\n\\n  The LGE-MRI image volumes and their associated left-atrial segmentations are\\n  stored in the NRRD (Nearly-Raw Raster Data) format, which is compatible with\\n  major medical image processing software such as 3D Slicer, Seg3D, ITKSnap,\\n  and other applications built from the Insight Toolkit (www.itk.org).\\n', 'description': 'left_atrium', 'acknowledgement': 'acknowledgement', 'keywords': '', 'contributors': '', 'publications': ''}}, 'parameters': {'number_of_particles': 512.0}}\n"
